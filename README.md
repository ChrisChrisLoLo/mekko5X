Part cyberdeck, part ortholinear. With 2 knobs and 2 large OLED displays, this keyboard can be used for animations, displaying information, or for controlling a GUI. The small form factor makes the board a unique ortholinear keyboard, or a powerful macropad. It could also double as a MIDI controller!

Powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico, this keyboard should have more than enough space and power for any kind of firmware you have in mind!

## Status
Pre-prototyping phase. Playing around with OLED drivers, and will look into how to get it working with QMK. Testing pending. Copy and build if you're sure you know what you're doing.

## Features
- 2 Rotary encoders
- 2 Oled displays on a SPI bus
- 4x10 matrix
- Powered by a RP2040

## Acknowledgements
Big thank you to [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) for greenlighting and sponsoring a project such as this! Overtime, I've come to appretiate the quality of the silkscreen and soldermask boards I get from PCBWay, and would strongly consider them if I had to sell or give a quality PCB to a friend or and customer. PCBWay has also given back to the community by supporting projects like these, so I strongly recommend them if you're looking to make a board for yourself!
